# Data Cleaning Process for the Titanic Dataset

This README documents the data cleaning process performed on the Titanic dataset, available on Kaggle (or wherever you sourced it).  The goal of this cleaning was to prepare the data for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning model training.  The process involved handling missing values, converting data types, and addressing potential inconsistencies.

## Dataset Description

The Titanic dataset contains information about passengers on the Titanic, including whether they survived, their age, sex, passenger class, ticket number, fare, cabin, and embarkation point.  The dataset is commonly used for learning data science techniques, particularly classification.

## Cleaning Steps

The following steps were taken to clean the data:

1. **Loading the Data:**
   - The dataset was loaded using pandas (or your preferred library).  The specific file name should be mentioned here (e.g., `train.csv`).

   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   df = pd.read_csv('train.csv') # Replace 'train.csv' with your file name

   Handling Missing Values:

Age: A significant number of missing values were present in the 'Age' column. These were handled by imputation. The strategy used (e.g., mean, median, or more sophisticated methods like KNN imputation) should be clearly stated. Example using median imputation:
Python

df['Age'].fillna(df['Age'].median(), inplace=True)
Cabin: The 'Cabin' column had a large number of missing values and was deemed less informative for this analysis. It was therefore dropped. Alternatively, you could discuss other strategies if used, like creating a new category for "Unknown" cabins.
Python

df.drop('Cabin', axis=1, inplace=True)
Embarked: A small number of missing values were present in the 'Embarked' column. These were filled with the most frequent value (mode).
Python

df['Embarked'].fillna(df['Embarked'].mode()[0], inplace=True)
Data Type Conversion:

The 'Sex' column was converted to numerical representation (e.g., 0 for male, 1 for female) using one-hot encoding or label encoding. It is important to be consistent with this throughout your analysis.
Python

df['Sex'] = df['Sex'].map({'male': 0, 'female': 1}) # Example using map
# Or using one-hot encoding:
# df = pd.get_dummies(df, columns=['Sex'], drop_first=True) # Creates 'Sex_male' column
Other data type conversions, if any (e.g., converting 'Pclass' to categorical), should be mentioned here.
Feature Engineering (Optional):

New features might have been created, such as combining 'SibSp' and 'Parch' into a 'FamilySize' feature. If this was done, explain the rationale and the code used.
Python

df['FamilySize'] = df['SibSp'] + df['Parch'] + 1 # +1 to include the passenger themselves
Outlier Handling (Optional):

If outliers were detected and handled (e.g., in the 'Fare' column), the methods used (e.g., IQR method, capping) should be described.
Data Validation:

After cleaning, the data was checked to ensure that there were no remaining missing values in the relevant columns and that the data types were correct. This step is crucial to ensure data quality.
Python

print(df.isnull().sum()) # Check for missing values
print(df.info())         # Check data types
Conclusion
This cleaned dataset is now ready for further analysis and model building.  This README provides a clear and reproducible record of the cleaning process, which is essential for data science projects.

Further Improvements (Optional)
Explore different imputation techniques for missing 'Age' values.
Investigate the impact of different feature engineering strategies.
Consider other outlier handling methods.
Visualize the data to gain insights into potential issues.
This README should be a good starting point and can be customized to reflect the specific cleaning steps you took. Remember to include the code snippets you used for each step.  This makes your process transparent and reproducible.
